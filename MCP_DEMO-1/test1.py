Here is an example of what the file `test1.py` could contain:


# This is a comment explaining the purpose of the script

def greet(name):
    """Prints out a greeting message for the given name"""
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

def add_numbers(a, b):
    """Returns the sum of two numbers"""
    return a + b

# Test the functions
greet("John")
print(add_numbers(5, 3))


This file contains two simple Python functions: `greet` and `add_numbers`. The comments above each function explain what they do, following good coding practices. The script then calls these functions with some test data to verify that they work as expected.

To create this file on your own, simply open a text editor (such as Notepad on Windows or TextEdit on macOS), paste the code into it, save the file as `test1.py`, and you'll have created your first Python script!
